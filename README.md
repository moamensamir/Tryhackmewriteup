# TryHackMe Writeups — Complete Room Solutions & Notes

Welcome to my TryHackMe Writeups Repository!
This repo contains all the rooms I’ve completed on TryHackMe
 — with step-by-step walkthroughs, commands, flags, and notes.
It’s also designed as a template for anyone who wants to document their own TryHackMe progress publicly.

# Purpose

This repository serves two main goals:

Personal progress tracker:
Every time I complete a room, I add a folder here with a short write-up, commands used, and flags found.

CTF players who want example room walkthroughs

Others who want a simple structure for their own TryHackMe writeups
